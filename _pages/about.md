I am a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (New York University). My advisor is Prof. Joan Bruna. I am working on theoretical aspects of generative modeling, theory of deep learning, optimization for continuous games, high-dimensional hypothesis testing and related topics at the intersection of machine learning, statistics and optimization. In 2019 I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Engineering Physics from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). In the summer of 2021 I interned at IBM Research AI (Yorktown Heights, NY) with Youssef Mroueh. In the summer of 2022 I interned at Microsoft Research New England (Cambridge, MA) with Lester Mackey. During the 2022-2023 school year I am a Visiting Researcher (part-time) at Meta in New York City, working with Ricky T. Q. Chen and Brandon Amos. 

My email address is cd2754 (at) nyu (dot) edu.
