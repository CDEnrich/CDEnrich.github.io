I am a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research New England, based in Cambridge, MA. In May 2024 I graduated from my PhD in Computer Science from NYU, where my advisor was Joan Bruna. I work on generative AI models (diffusion models, normalizing flows) and related topics at the intersection of machine learning, statistics and optimization. During my PhD, I interned at IBM Research and Microsoft Research, and was a Visiting Researcher at Meta FAIR Labs for two years. 
In 2019 I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Engineering Physics from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC).  

My email address is _cd2754 (at) nyu (dot) edu_.

Excited to open source the code for Adjoint Matching --- as part of a new repo centered around reward fine-tuning via stochastic optimal control! [https://github.com/microsoft/soc-fine-tuning-sd](https://github.com/microsoft/soc-fine-tuning-sd)
