I am a fifth and final year PhD student in Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (New York University), approaching my final year. My advisor is Prof. Joan Bruna. I am working on generative modeling (diffusion models, normalizing flows), theory of deep learning, optimization for continuous games, high-dimensional hypothesis testing, and related topics at the intersection of machine learning, statistics and optimization. 

In 2019 I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Engineering Physics from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). 
In the summer of 2021 I interned at IBM Research AI (Yorktown Heights, NY) with Youssef Mroueh. 
In the summer of 2022 I interned at Microsoft Research New England (Cambridge, MA) with Lester Mackey. 
Since October 2022, I have been a Visiting Researcher (part-time) at Meta FAIR Labs in New York City, working with Ricky T. Q. Chen and Brandon Amos. 

My email address is _cd2754 (at) nyu (dot) edu_.
